# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - force_cast
  - force_try
excluded: # case-sensitive paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`
  - Pods
reporter: "xcode" # reporter type (xcode, json, csv, checkstyle, junit, html, emoji, sonarqube, markdown)
